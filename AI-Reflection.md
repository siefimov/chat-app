# AI Reflection

## How I use AI in learning and development

* **Understanding new concepts:** When I encounter unfamiliar technologies, frameworks, or coding patterns, I often turn to AI to get initial explanations and breakdowns of complex topics. It helps me ***get the fundamentals more quickly***.
* **Exploring different approaches:** If I'm handle a particular problem, I use AI to brainstorm alternative solutions and explore different implementation strategies that I might not have considered.
* **Debugging and troubleshooting:** When I'm stuck on a bug, AI can be helpful in suggesting potential causes and guiding me towards solutions by analyzing error messages and code snippets.
* **Learning by example:** I often ask AI to provide examples of how to implement specific features or use certain APIs, which gives me practical **starting points** for my own code.
* **Reviewing my code:** I sometimes use AI to review my code for potential improvements in terms of readability, efficiency, and adherence to best practices.

## Which tools or models (ChatGPT, Copilot, Perplexity, etc.) have you tried?

I have tried **ChatGPT**, **GitHub Copilot**, **Gemini**. 

## What really helps to grow, and what hinders?

**What really helps me grow:**

* **Combining AI with traditional learning resources:** AI is a great supplement to documentation, tutorials, and online courses, helping me understand concepts in different ways.
* **Experimenting and iterating:** Trying out AI-generated suggestions and then adapting them to my specific needs helps solidify my understanding and improve my problem-solving skills.
* **Focusing on understanding the "why" behind the code:** Instead of just blindly accepting AI's suggestions, I make an effort to understand the underlying principles and logic.
* **Using AI as a starting point, not the final answer:** AI-generated code or explanations are often a good starting point, but critical thinking and further refinement are always necessary for production-ready code.

**What hinders my growth:**

When using AI in the code editor, particularly its automatic code completion features, I've realized that it can sometimes be more of a barrier than a help for me. I find myself getting distracted from my own thought process as I constantly need to shift my attention to the suggestions provided by the AI. This back-and-forth of evaluating and potentially accepting AI-generated code disrupts my flow and makes me feel like I'm losing control over the coding process, which ultimately delay my progress.

## How I would integrate AI into my front-end workflow

* speed up test generation; 
* automate routine tasks; 
* code review;
* documentation generation;
* content generation.
